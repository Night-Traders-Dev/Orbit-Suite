## Enhanced Prime Crypto

```
A hybrid cryptographic utility that combines symmetric and asymmetric encryption using advanced techniques such as 
dynamic S-boxes, prime-seeded keystreams, and RSA public-key infrastructure. 
It now includes integrity checks, secure key wrapping, and metadata embedding for more robust encryption workflows.
```

## Features

* Symmetric encryption using a custom stream cipher

* Dynamic key and IV handling based on SHA-256, PBKDF2, and prime sequences

* Authenticated encryption with HMAC-SHA256

* Asymmetric RSA encryption for hybrid key exchange

* Secure file encryption/decryption and RSA key management

* Encrypted metadata embedding (filename, timestamp, encryption parameters)

* Key wrapping for securely storing symmetric keys using RSA

* Integrity verification before decryption using embedded HMAC

* CLI interface for convenience

## Key Concepts

# Prime-Seeded Keystream

A stream cipher based on a sequence of prime numbers derived from a password-derived seed and enhanced with a dynamic S-box.

# Hybrid Encryption

Combines RSA to encrypt a symmetric key which is then used to encrypt the data. Ensures both confidentiality and secure key exchange.

# HMAC Authentication

Each ciphertext is appended with a MAC computed from part of the password-derived key material, verifying data integrity and authenticity.

# Key Wrapping

Symmetric keys are encrypted (wrapped) with the recipientâ€™s RSA public key, decoupling them from direct password dependence.

# Embedded Metadata

Encrypted files contain embedded metadata (e.g., original filename, encryption parameters) to simplify decryption and auditing.

## Notes

Key generation uses 2048-bit RSA by default (configurable).

Encrypted private keys can be protected with a user passphrase.

The encryption scheme is experimental and not audited for production use.
